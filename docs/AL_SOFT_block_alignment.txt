Dependencies

    This extension is for OpenAL 1.1.
    This extension interacts with AL_SOFT_buffer_samples.
    This extension interacts with AL_SOFT_buffer_sub_data.
    This extension interacts with AL_EXT_IMA4.
    This extension interacts with AL_SOFT_MSADPCM.

Overview

    This extension provides a mechanism for specifying block alignment
    properties for sample data. This is useful for, though not strictly
    limited to, ADPCM compression where the block alignment is specified in
    the media file header instead of the data stream, and controls the
    decoding process.

Issues

    Q: How should the block alignment be specified?
    A: As the number of sample frames per block. Although certain formats,
       like .wav, store the block alignment in bytes, sample frames is easier
       to manage.

    Q: How does changing the block alignment affect sample data that's already
       loaded?
    A: It doesn't. The block alignment is used when unpacking (reading) and
       packing (writing) samples when the application calls, but does not
       affect how stored data is interpreted.

Additions to Specification

    Sample Data Block Alignment

    Sample data is read and written as a collection of one or more blocks. A
    block is a collection of one or more sample frames, which in turn contain
    one sample for each channel.

    Table x.1. Buffer AL_PACK_BLOCK_ALIGNMENT_SOFT Attribute

    Name                            Signature  Values          Default
    ------------------------------  ---------  --------------  -------
    AL_PACK_BLOCK_ALIGNMENT_SOFT    i, iv      [0, MAX_INT]    0


    The buffer's block alignment attributes specify the number of sample
    frames in each block when unpacking and packing sample data. Unpacking
    occurs during calls to alBufferData, and alBufferSubDataSOFT if
    AL_SOFT_buffer_sub_data is supported, and alBufferSamplesSOFT and
    alBufferSubSamplesSOFT if AL_SOFT_buffer_samples is supported, Packing
    occurs during calls to alGetBufferSamplesSOFT if AL_SOFT_buffer_samples is
    supported.

    By default, the block alignment for unpacking and packing samples is set
    to 0. This indicates the minimum alignment (1) is used for PCM sample
    formats.

    If the AL_EXT_IMA4 extension is supported, the block alignment controls
    the number of sample frames encoded per IMA ADPCM block, and so also
    affects the bitrate. The block alignment must be a multiple of 8, plus 1
    (i.e. alignment = n*8 + 1), or an AL_INVALID_VALUE error will occur during
    unpacking or packing IMA4 samples. A block alignment of 0 indicates a
    default of 65 sample frames per block for IMA4 sample formats.

    If the AL_SOFT_MSADPCM extension is supported, the block alignment
    controls the number of sample frames encoded per MSADPCM block, and so
    also affects the bitrate. The block alignment must be a multiple of 2, or
    an AL_INVALID_VALUE error will occur during unpacking or packing MSADPCM
    samples. A block alignment of 0 indicates a default of 64 sample frames
    per block for MSADPCM sample formats.

Errors

    An AL_INVALID_VALUE error is generating during unpacking or packing
    operations if the unpack block alignment or pack block alignment isn't an
    appropriate value for the format.
