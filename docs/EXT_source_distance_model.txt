Dependancies

    This extension is written against the OpenAL 1.1 specification.

Overview

    This extension allows each source to specify a distance model, instead of
    being restricted to one distance model for every source in the context. It
    provides a mechanism for applications to apply different models to each
    source, without the burden of manually applying the attenuation through
    the source gain.

Issues

    Q: ALint and ALenum are being used inter-changeably. Is that OK? Are they
       always the same size (32 bits) on all platforms?
    A: Yes, and yes. Both ALint and ALenum are typedef'd to int, and OpenAL
       already passes ALenum values through an ALint (such as when calling
       alGetInteger with AL_DISTANCE_MODEL), so there should be no problems
       passing a distance model enum through al[Get]Sourcei.

    Q: What happens when some of the sources are set to something other than
       the default and then the application calls alDistanceModel()?
    A: The sources' property is maintained separately from the context's
       distance model setting. Calling alDistanceModel will set the context's
       setting, which is only used when the AL_SOURCE_DISTANCE_MODEL context
       state is disabled (the default). Similarly, setting a source's
       AL_DISTANCE_MODEL property will only have an audible affect when the
       context state is enabled.

    Q: What is the purpose of having different distance models for each
       source?
    A: Different sounds may want different rolloff properties. For instance,
       some sounds may want to follow a more natural inverse distance rolloff,
       while others may want to use linear or a manual method to ensure a sound
       reaches 0 gain at max distance. Unextended OpenAL only allows using
       custom rolloffs by setting the AL_NONE distance model or a 0 rolloff
       factor, both of which can have other side effects (eg. disabling air
       absorption effects from EFX).

New Procedures and Functions

    None.

New Tokens

    Accepted by the <target> parameter of alEnable, alDisable, and
    alIsEnabled:

Additions to Specification

    Append Section 2.8 (Controlling AL Execution, p. 17)

    The table below specifies the acceptable target capabilities:

    Table 2.x: Context capability targets

    Name                      Description
    ------------------------  -----------------
    AL_SOURCE_DISTANCE_MODEL  Enables use of the distance model specified by
                              the sources' AL_DISTANCE_MODEL property,
                              superceding the context's distance model setting
                              (default is disabled)


    Modify Table 3.1 (Numerical Query Definitions), p. 22

    Name                      Description
    -----------------         -----------------
    ...
    AL_DISTANCE_MODEL         The current context-wide distance model


    Modify Section 3.4 (Attenuation By Distance), p. 24

    (modify starting from third paragraph)
    OpenAL currently supports three modes of operation with respect to
    distance attenuation, including one that is similar to the IASIG I3DL2
    model. The application can choose one of these models (or chooses to
    disable distance-dependent attenuation) on per-source or a per-context
    basis. The function

    void alDistanceModel(ALenum modelName);

    changes the context distance model, used by default for all sources in the
    current context. Legal arguments are: ...


    Modify Section 4.3.2 (Source Attributes)

    (add to subsection Distance Model Attributes, p. 38)
    Table 4.x: DISTANCE_MODEL Attribute
    Name                Signature   Values      Default
    -----------------   ---------   ---------   ---------------------------
    AL_DISTANCE_MODEL   i, iv       any valid   AL_INVERSE_DISTANCE_CLAMPED
                                    modelName

    Description: the distance model used when calculating the source's
    distance-dependent attenuation. By default, all sources will use the
    context's distance model. This attribute will only be used when the
    AL_SOURCE_DISTANCE_MODEL context capability target is enabled.

    The valid modelNames are the same as those for alDistanceModel (detailed
    in Section 3.4).


Errors

    An AL_INVALID_VALUE error is generated if alSourcei or alSourceiv is
    called with AL_DISTANCE_MODEL and the given model name is not valid.
