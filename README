1. Intrudoction

AeonWave-OpenAL is a thin OpenAL emulation layer on top of the AeonWave Audio
eXtension library. This means that in order for it to operate one of the
libaax2 binary packages should be installed:

libaax2-<version>.el6.i386-bin.deb
libaax2-<version>.el6.i386-bin.rpm
libaax2-<version>.el6.x86_64-bin.deb
libaax2-<version>.el6.x86_64-bin.rpm

To be able to compile AeonWave-OpenAL yourself the libaax2 development package
should also be installed:

libaax2-<version>.el6.i386-dev.deb
libaax2-<version>.el6.i386-dev.rpm
libaax2-<version>.el6.x86_64-dev.deb
libaax2-<version>.el6.x86_64-dev.rpm


2. Compiling and Installing

The best procedure to compile and install AeonWave-OpenAL is to create a new
build directory in the root of the unzipped source file package and run cmake
from there:

unzip aaxopenal-<version>.zip
cd aaxopenal-<version>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
