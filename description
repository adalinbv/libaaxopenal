OpenAL layer for the AeonWave 4D audio library
 A very thin emulation layer that uses AeonWave to create one of the fastest
 rendering OpenAL implementations available.
 .
 This package can be used to replace OpenAL-Soft and OpenAL-Sample.
 AeonWave-OpenAL will render 4 to 6 times faster than OpenAL-Soft and 7 to 12 
 times faster than OpenAL-Sample by making use of the hardware acceleration
 and multi-threading capabilities of the AeonWave audio library.
 .
 OpenAL is a cross-platform 3D audio API appropriate for use with gaming
 applications and many other types of audio applications. Its API style and
 conventions deliberately resemble those of OpenGL.
