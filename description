OpenAL layer for the AeonWave 4D audio library
 A very thin emulation layer that uses AeonWave to create one of the fastest
 rendering OpenAL implementations available.
 .
 This package can be used to replace OpenAL-Soft and OpenAL-Sample.
 AeonWave-OpenAL will render 5 to 7 times faster than either OpenAL-Soft or
 OpenAL-Sample since it makes use of the hardware acceleration provided by
 AeonWave.
 .
 OpenAL is a cross-platform 3D audio API appropriate for use with gaming
 applications and many other types of audio applications. Its API style and
 conventions deliberately resemble those of OpenGL.
